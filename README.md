# 🧮 Full Stack Calculator | Foundations Practice (FastAPI + JavaScript)

![Calculator Screenshot](frontend/calculator-py.png)

This project is part of my **Full Stack Lab** — a collection of small, focused builds across my tech stack.  
Each project reinforces a different foundation before scaling up to larger systems.

##  Project Purpose

This calculator was built to **revisit and strengthen my fundamentals** across both backend and frontend:
-  **Python / FastAPI** → reinforcing function logic, modularization, and API creation  
-  **JavaScript / DOM** → practicing frontend event handling and async API communication  
-  **Testing** → implementing proper **unit tests** and **integration tests** with `pytest` and `TestClient`  

It’s intentionally simple — built to ensure that the basics (input, output, error handling, communication between layers) are rock-solid before moving to more complex projects.

##  Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Python 3.12
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (for local development)
- Pytest (for unit and integration testing)

**Frontend**
- Vanilla JavaScript (fetch + DOM)
- HTML / CSS
- Simple UI with glassmorphic styling
